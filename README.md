### Domain-Driven Design example

This project is an example of a .NET implementation of a medical prescription model using the "Domain-Driven Design" (DDD) approach  and the "Command and Query Responsibility Segregation" (CQRS) architectural pattern.

**Points of interest**

This project has been created to test an implementation in .NET of the core concepts of DDD (entities, value objects, domain events, ...) and CQRS (commands, queries, command and query handlers, ...) on the basis of a concrete model.

The final goal of the project is to develop, for personal use, the main components of a message-based architecture that combines the benefits of the Hexagonal Architecture, CQRS and DDD, namely :

-	reusability of the application code
-	isolation of the business and application logic from external dependencies
-	reduction of complexity by splitting the system into smaller parts with high cohesion and low coupling
-	maintainability, testability and readability of code
-	encapsulation of the business logic and rules in domain objects if necessary

The scalability of the system is important, but is not the main concern. I want to develop a solution that combines the above-mentioned benefits, but that is accessible to small development teams and that can be deployed in different types of environment. For this reason, only a light version of CQRS (no data projection, one data store) has been considered and no messaging framework (like Apache Kafka or NServiceBus) has been used.

The main components are developed from technologies commonly used by .NET developers :

-	a relational database
-	an ORM framework
-	an Ioc container

**Architecture**

The architecture of the project is based on the Hexagonal Architecture. The main concepts of the Hexagonal Architecture are clearly explained in the article [Hexagonal Architecture, there are always two sides to every story](https://medium.com/ssense-tech/hexagonal-architecture-there-are-always-two-sides-to-every-story-bc0780ed7d9c). Applying the architectural pattern CQRS in this architecture offers many benefits :
-	the input ports (driving ports) of the application are represented by two generic fine-grained interfaces (ICommandHandler and IQueryHandler) defining the command and query handlers 
-	on the query side, the architecture is simplified as shown in the diagrams below : the input and output ports are represented by the same interface (IQueryHandler) defining the query handlers, the application layer is reduced to a few objects (queries and results) participating to the definition of this interface 
-	by separating command and query sides, the output ports (driven ports) used by the application to persist aggregates on the command side can also be represented by a generic fine-grained interface (IRepository)
-	the small interfaces defining the input and output ports can be easily decorated to implement cross-cutting concerns like logging or error handling. It is particularly relevant to apply resilient policies (retry strategies, â€¦) around the execution of a command or a query because they represent a whole (holistic abstraction) : you can retry a command or a query, but not a part of it.
-	It is easy to establish a mechanism to perform background recurring tasks : recurring commands can be stored in a database and processed on a recurring basis

**Message handling**

In a message-based application, 3 types of messages can be handled :

-	a command : a message that carries data about an operation that changes the state of the application
-	a query : a message that carries data about an operation that reads the state of the application
-	an event : a message that carries data about something that has happened in the application

Commands and queries are usually handled synchronously and events asynchronously. Some events called "domain events" capture an occurrence of something that has happened in the domain and that is considered important by business experts. These events generally register that the state of the application (more precisely the state of an aggregate) has changed and they occur during the processing of a command. It is important to transactionally record this change and the associated event(s). A simple way to do this is to record them in the same database. This is the way taken by the project : events and aggregates are saved in the same database. 

**Model**

The model considered is a simplified model reflecting the life cycle of a medical prescription and, in particular, of a pharmaceutical prescription. This life cycle can be summarized by the following diagram.

![Alt Prescription Lifecycle](https://github.com/draphyz/DDD/blob/entityframework/Doc/PrescriptionLifecycle.png)

The current model only takes into account the use cases related to the prescriber : the creation and revocation of a prescription.

_Command Model_

On the write side, a rich domain model has been used to encapsulate the business logic and to control the creation of domain events. This model represents the business model. It incorporates both behavior and data, and is composed of entities and value objects. 

The domain modeling has been focused on two important aspects :
-	Encapsulation (to ensure that the aggregate is in a consistent state at all times)
-	Separation of concerns (also known as persistence ignorance)

Therefore, the domain model has been implemented as an object model without public setters and by hiding some information (like database identifiers for the value objects).  Entity inheritance and value object inheritance has been used and some value types like enumerations has been implemented as value objects.

Two options has been considered to map the domain objects to the database tables :
-	Mapping the domain model directly to the database by using a flexible and mature ORM like NHibernate 5 (branch nhibernate).

![Alt NHibernate Mapping](https://github.com/draphyz/DDD/blob/entityframework/Doc/NHibernateMapping.png)

-	Mapping the domain model to an intermediate model (state or persistence model) and then mapping the intermediate model to the database by using a less flexible and mature ORM like Entity Framework Core (branch entityframework).

![Alt Entity Framework Mapping](https://github.com/draphyz/DDD/blob/entityframework/Doc/EntityFrameworkMapping.png)

By comparing the purity/complexity ratios of the two options, the first option is preferred to map the domain model to the database. In the branch "NHibernate", some minor changes have been made to the domain model, such as adding protected constructors or private setters.

The interactions between the main components on the write side can be represented as follows :

_Query Model_

As mentioned above, the command and query data stores are not differentiated but the architecture on the query side is simplified (as shown on the following diagram). The query side is composed of simple Data Transfer Objects mapped to the database by using the Micro ORM Dapper.

**Organization of code**

The libraries are distributed by component (bounded context) :

- The "Core" libraries include the core components (Entity, ValueObject, CommandHandler, ...) necessary to implement the DDD approach according to the CQRS architectural pattern.
- The "Common" libraries include common components (EmailAddress, FullName, ...) that can be reused in multiple bounded contexts (shared kernel).
- The "HealthcareDelivery" libraries include components related to the context of healthcare delivery.

The application layer can be tested by using the "DDD.HealthcareDelivery.IntegrationTests" project.

**Cross-cutting concerns**

The decorator pattern is especially useful in CQRS to handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging or error handling. Command or query handlers (small interfaces) can be easily decorated. You will find some examples of decorators in the "DDD.Core.Polly" and "DDD.Core" projects.

Exception chaining (or exception wrapping) has been used. Each abstraction has its own set of exceptions :

- ISerializer throws a SerializationException
- IObjectMapper or IObjectTranslator throws a MappingException
- IRepository throws a RepositoryException
- IQueryHandler throws a QueryException
- ICommandHandler throws a CommandException

The Domain and Application layers have their own base exception class (respectively DomainException and ApplicationException). These classes defines a property IsTransient indicating whether the exception is transient.
